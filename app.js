// The idea is that if we are able to reach this point where app.all() is running, then it means that the request-response cycle was not yet finished at this point in our code, right. Because remember that middleware is added to the middleware stack in the order that it's defined here in our code. And so basically this code here runs first, and so if the route was matched here in our userRoute then our request would never even reach this code, and so then this would not get executed. And so this should basically be the last part after all our other routes, all right.
